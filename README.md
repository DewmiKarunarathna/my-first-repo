## My rock paper scissors game
- i used python random library to let the computer select rock, paper, scissor randomly
- players can play against computer
- wihtout tie marks, after the given playing attempts, if the player scores more than the computer, the player wins!
- i included a new function to let the player decide of having instructions or not
